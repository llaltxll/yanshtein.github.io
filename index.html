				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<h5>Developer <span>& Designer</span></h5>
				<p>
					I am looking for a job in as a web developer.<br/>
					I've gained experience working in front-end & back-end environments by doing the following:<br/>
					
					Dr.chuck's exellent Python4Everybody - learned the basics of object oriented programming and data structures
					Dr.chuck's equally good Django4EveryBody - followed instructions to build CRUD web apps using the Django framework.
					In D4E we used SQL-lite for testing and later migrated to MySQL for production
					We designed a DB-schema with one to many and many to many relation ships and later populated the db from a JSON object(or was it a CSV?)
				        using a Django script.
					We built Django views ushing Django-template-language to enable the creation, read, update and deletion of model data.
					Some othe topics covered in D4E are OAuth, API usage, etc..
					
					I've built my own projects on codepen.<br/>
					
					<span>The findBy project:</span><br/>
					The project was built during few months, where I tried to take what I've learned in the course and build a site using this knowledge.		
					The site uses responsive design for mobile devices. you can access links clicking on the toggle button that appears on mobile.
					A user shuold be able to login or signup using a OAuth(github/google/fb) , or create a local account.
					While logged in the user can favorite ads, create an ad, and see your favorites in a specific section in your profile. 
					you can as well click on contact button and while logged in you can see contact name and phone number behind the button which will dissapear on click using JavaScript.
