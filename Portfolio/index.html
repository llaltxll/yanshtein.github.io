				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<h5>Developer <span>& Designer</span></h5>
				<p>
					I am looking for a job in the web development field.<br/>
					I've gained some experience working in the front-end & back-end environments.<br/>
					Building a small databases from movies JSON file or personal details, using Django as the back-end for DB management,<br/>
					and CSS for withing Django templates.
					I've also build my own small projects some on codepen and some local.<br/>
					<span>The findBy project:</span><br/>
					The project was built during few months, where I tried to take what I've learned in the course and build a site with this knowledge.		
					The site uses responsive design for mobile devices. you can access links clicking on the toggle button that appears on mobile.
					The idea of this site is that you can login or signup using social account, or create account on site.
					While logged in you can favorite ads, create an ad, and see your favorites in a specific section in your profile. 
					you can as well click on contact button and while logged in you can see contact name and phone number behind the button which will dissapear on click using JavaScript.
